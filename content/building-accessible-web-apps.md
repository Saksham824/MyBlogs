Accessibility is not a feature — it’s a fundamental right. Every user deserves equal access to your web app, regardless of ability.
</Callout>

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility ensures your website is usable by people with various disabilities, such as:

- Visual impairments (blindness, color blindness)
- Hearing impairments
- Motor impairments
- Cognitive challenges

Not only does it help users, but it also:

- Improves SEO
- Broadens your audience
- Helps with legal compliance (ADA, WCAG)

## Use Semantic HTML

Using proper semantic elements helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand your content.

```html
<!-- ❌ Bad -->
<div onclick="goHome()">Go Home</div>

<!-- ✅ Good -->
<button onclick="goHome()">Go Home</button>

## Make Forms Accessible

- Use <label> tags linked to inputs with for / id.
- Provide meaningful error messages.
- Use aria-describedby to connect hints/help text.

## Keyboard Navigation Support

All interactive components (menus, modals, sliders) must be fully operable via keyboard:

- Use tabIndex
- Handle Enter and Space
- Avoid keyboard traps

<Callout emoji="⌨️"> Press `Tab` through your UI regularly to test its keyboard accessibility. </Callout>

## Color Contrast & Focus
Ensure:

- Text/background color contrast meets WCAG AA/AAA standards.
- Focus outlines are visible and not removed.
Avoid relying on color alone to convey meaning.

<Callout emoji="🎨"> Use tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to validate your UI colors. </Callout>

## Testing for Accessibility
Use a combination of:

- Automated tools: Lighthouse, axe DevTools, WAVE
- Manual testing: Keyboard only, screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA)
- User testing: Involve people with disabilities if possible

## Conclusion

Building accessible web apps isn't just ethical — it's a smart, inclusive, and sustainable choice for your users and business. Start small, improve incrementally, and bake accessibility into your development workflow.

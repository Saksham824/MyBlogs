# Next.js vs Remix

<Callout emoji="‚öîÔ∏è">
This is a side-by-side comparison between **Next.js** and **Remix**.
</Callout>

## Overview

**Next.js** follows a **hybrid approach**, supporting both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR). It uses **file-based routing** and is backed by Vercel.

**Remix** is **server-first** and deeply integrated with web standards. It leans on **nested routing** and emphasizes **progressive enhancement** for the browser.

## Key Differences

| Feature                | Next.js                                   | Remix                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Data Fetching          | Static Generation, SSR, ISR, CSR          | Loaders (server-side by default)           |
| Routing                | File-based routing                        | File-based routing                         |
| API Routes             | Built-in API routes                       | No built-in API routes                     |
| Deployment             | Vercel, any Node.js server, static export | Any Node.js server, edge, serverless       |
| Caching                | ISR, SWR, custom                          | Built-in caching with loaders              |
| Streaming              | Partial support (React 18)                | Full support (React 18)                    |
| Pricing                | Free, with paid Vercel features           | Paid (Remix license), now open-source      |

## üöÄ Performance

- **Next.js** uses techniques like **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** and **Edge Middleware**.
- **Remix** prioritizes streaming data and native browser features like `fetch`, `FormData`, and HTTP caching.

üîç *Remix often feels faster for user interactions because of better data flow handling and granular caching.*

---

## When to Use Next.js

- You want a mature, stable framework with a large ecosystem.
- You need built-in API routes.
- You want to deploy easily to Vercel or use static site generation.

## When to Use Remix

- You want fine-grained control over data loading and caching.
- You need advanced routing and nested layouts.
- You want to leverage the latest React features (like streaming) out of the box.

## üîß Developer Experience

| Aspect              | Next.js                        | Remix                            |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| CLI & setup         | Mature, well-documented        | Simple but still evolving        |
| Learning curve      | Easier for beginners           | Steeper but consistent           |
| Data fetching       | `getServerSideProps`, etc.     | `loader` and `action` functions  |

**Next.js** feels more accessible with its built-in `App` and `Document` structure. **Remix**, however, provides more control over routing and data per component level.

---

## üß™ Testing & Flexibility

- **Next.js** is battle-tested in production (e.g., Vercel, TikTok, Hulu).
- **Remix** is newer but rapidly growing in popularity and backed by Shopify.

You might prefer **Next.js** if:
- You want static site generation or ISR.
- You prefer a larger ecosystem and more tutorials.
- You're already using Vercel for deployment.

Choose **Remix** if:
- You love web fundamentals and full control.
- You‚Äôre building highly interactive apps with nested routes.
- You value built-in forms and loaders.

## Example: Data Fetching

**Next.js (getServerSideProps):**

```js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();
  return { props: { data } };
}

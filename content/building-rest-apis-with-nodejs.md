## ðŸ”§ Why Use Node.js?

Node.js is ideal for building REST APIs due to its:

- Non-blocking, event-driven architecture
- Lightweight nature
- Rich ecosystem (npm)
- High performance for I/O-heavy tasks

---

## ðŸ§± Setting Up a Basic API with Express

First, initialize your project:

```bash
mkdir my-api && cd my-api
npm init -y
npm install express
Create your entry point (index.js):


const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

// Sample route
app.get("/api/hello", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Hello, world!" });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));

âœ… Best Practices

- Use environment variables (dotenv)
- Add input validation (e.g., Joi, zod)
- Handle errors consistently (centralized middleware)
- Structure code for scalability
- Secure API (rate limiting, helmet, CORS)

ðŸ§ª Testing Your API
Use tools like:

- Postman or Insomnia for manual testing
- Jest or Mocha for unit/integration testing
- Supertest for HTTP assertions

ðŸš€ Conclusion
Node.js makes it easy to build fast, scalable REST APIs. With Express and a clear structure, you can create APIs ready for production with confidence.
